## Collaboration

### Issues assigning

For avoiding situations than two contributors started resolving the same issue, recommending:

1. Make yourself assignee at issue, or, if you haven't rights for this, write a comment at the issue about you started making.
2. Move issue to "In Progress" column at [next](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma/projects/2) board.

### Development Chat

Feel free to discuss any problem at the [#development](https://spectrum.chat/react-figma/development?tab=posts) channel on our Spectrum.

## Developing

### Local Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 8 and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
2. Install webpack & dependencies: `yarn global add webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server`
3. Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:react-figma/react-figma.git`
4. Go to directory: `cd react-figma`
5. Install dependencies: `yarn`

### Online one-click Setup

You can use Gitpod(An online IDE which is free for Open Source) for the online one-click setup. With a single click it will launch a workspace and automatically: 

- Clone the `react-figma` repo.
- Install the dependencies in `/` and `/website` i.e `webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server`.
- Run `npm run webpack:watch` in the `auto-layout` example directory.
- Run `yarn start` in `/website` to start the `docusaurus` server.
